ZDUMP(8)                    System Manager's Manual                   ZDUMP(8)

NAME
       zdump - time zone dumper

SYNOPSIS
       zdump [ --version ] [ -v ] [ -V ] [ -c [loyear,]hiyear ] [ -t
       [lotime,]hitime ] [ zonename ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Zdump prints the current time in each zonename named on the command
       line.

       These options are available:

       --version
              Output version information and exit.

       -v     For each zonename on the command line, print the time at the
              lowest possible time value, the time one day after the lowest
              possible time value, the times both one second before and
              exactly at each detected time discontinuity, the time at one day
              less than the highest possible time value, and the time at the
              highest possible time value, Each line ends with isdst=1 if the
              given time is Daylight Saving Time or isdst=0 otherwise.

       -V     Like -v, except omit the times relative to the extreme time
              values.  This generates output that is easier to compare to that
              of implementations with different time representations.

       -c [loyear,]hiyear
              Cut off verbose output near the start of the given year(s).  By
              default, the program cuts off verbose output near the starts of
              the years -500 and 2500.

       -t [lotime,]hitime
              Cut off verbose output at the start of the given time(s), given
              in decimal seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.

LIMITATIONS
       The -v and -V options may not be used on systems with floating-point
       time_t values that are neither float nor double.

       Time discontinuities are found by sampling the results returned by
       localtime at twelve-hour intervals.  This works in all real-world
       cases; one can construct artificial time zones for which this fails.
